    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Large Language Models, while recognized for creating human-like text, can also \"hallucinate\" and produce seemingly plausible yet incorrect or nonsensical information. Interestingly, this tendency can be advantageous in creative tasks, as it generates a range of unique and imaginative ideas, sparking new perspectives and driving the creative process. However, this poses a challenge in situations where accuracy is critical, such as code reviews, insurance-related tasks, or research question responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to mitigating hallucination is to provide documents as sources of information to the LLM and ask it to generate an answer based on the knowledge extracted from the document. This can help reduce the likelihood of hallucination, and users can verify the information with the source document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss the pros and cons of this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pros:**\n",
    "- Reduced hallucination: By providing a source document, the LLM is more likely to generate content based on the given information, reducing the chances of creating false or irrelevant information.\n",
    "- Increased accuracy: With a reliable source document, the LLM can generate more accurate answers, especially in use cases where accuracy is crucial.\n",
    "- Verifiable information: Users can cross-check the generated content with the source document to ensure the information is accurate and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cons:**\n",
    "- Limited scope: Relying on a single document may limit the scope of the generated content, as the LLM will only have access to the information provided in the document.\n",
    "- Dependence on document quality: The accuracy of the generated content heavily depends on the quality and reliability of the source document. The LLM will likely generate incorrect or misleading content if the document contains inaccurate or biased information.\n",
    "- Inability to eliminate hallucination completely: Although providing a document as a base reduces the chances of hallucination, it does not guarantee that the LLM will never generate false or irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing another challenge, LLMs have a maximum prompt size, preventing them from feeding entire documents. This makes it crucial to divide documents into smaller parts, and Text Splitters prove to be extremely useful in achieving this. Text Splitters help break down large text documents into smaller, more digestible pieces that language models can process more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Text Splitter can also improve vector store search results, as smaller segments might be more likely to match a query. Experimenting with different chunk sizes and overlaps can be beneficial in tailoring results to suit your specific needs."

    "## **Customizing Text Splitter**\n",
    "When handling lengthy pieces of text, it's crucial to break them down into manageable chunks. This seemingly simple task can quickly become complex, as keeping semantically related text segments intact is essential. The definition of \"semantically related\" may vary depending on the type of text. In this article, we'll explore various strategies to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, text splitters follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the text into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\n",
    "2. Combine these small chunks into a larger one until a specific size is reached (determined by a particular function).\n",
    "3. Once the desired size is attained, separate that chunk as an individual piece of text, then start forming a new chunk with some overlap to maintain context between segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, there are two primary dimensions to consider when customizing your text splitter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The method used to split the text\n",
    "2. The approach for measuring chunk size"

For example, you might use it to split a long article into smaller chunks for easier processing or analysis. The splitter allows you to customize the chunking process along two axes - chunk size and chunk overlap - to balance the trade-offs between splitting the text into manageable pieces and preserving semantic context between chunks.\n",

    "## **Recursive Character Text Splitter**\n",
    "The Recursive Character Text Splitter is a text splitter designed to split the text into chunks based on a list of characters provided. It attempts to split text using the characters from a list in order until the resulting chunks are small enough. By default, the list of characters used for splitting is `[\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \"]`, which tries to keep paragraphs, sentences, and words together as long as possible, as they are generally the most semantically related pieces of text. This means that the class first tries to split the text into chunks using two new-line characters (`\"\\n\\n\"`). If the resulting chunks are still larger than the desired chunk size, it will then try to split the output by a single new-line character (`\"\\n\"`), followed by a space character (`\" \"`), and so on, until the desired chunk size is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, you can create an instance of it and provide the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_size`: The maximum size of the chunks, as measured by the `length_function` (default is 100).\n",
    "- `chunk_overlap`: The maximum overlap between chunks to maintain continuity between them (default is 20).\n",
    "- `length_function`: This parameter is used to calculate the length of the chunks. By default, it is set to `len`, which counts the number of characters in a chunk. However, you can also pass a token counter or any other function that calculates the length of a chunk based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a token counter instead of the default `len` function can benefit specific scenarios, such as when working with language models with token limits. For example, OpenAI's GPT-3 has a token limit of 4096 tokens per request, so you might want to count tokens instead of characters to better manage and optimize your requests.\n",

    "- `CharacterTextSplitter` is an example that helps balance manageable pieces and semantic context preservation. Experimenting with different chunk sizes and overlaps tailors the results for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` focuses on preserving semantic relationships while offering customizable chunk sizes and overlaps.\n",

    "- `SpacyTextSplitter` leverages the popular SpaCy library to split texts based on linguistic features.\n",
