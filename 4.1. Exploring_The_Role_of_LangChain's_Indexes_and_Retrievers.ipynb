    "In LangChain, indexes and retrievers play a crucial role in structuring documents and fetching relevant data for LLMs. We will explore some of the advantages and disadvantages of using document-based LLMs (i.e., LLMs that leverage relevant pieces of documents inside their prompts), with a particular focus on the role of indexes and retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is a powerful data structure that meticulously organizes and stores documents to enable efficient searching, while a retriever harnesses the index to locate and return pertinent documents in response to user queries. Within LangChain, the primary index types are centered on vector databases, with embeddings-based indexes being the most prevalent.\n",

    "## **What occurred behind the scenes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we employed a so-called **\"stuff chain\"** (refer to CombineDocuments Chains). Stuffing is one way to supply information to the LLM. ***Using this technique, we \"stuff\" all the information into the LLM's prompt. However, this method is only effective with shorter documents, as most LLMs have a context length limit.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a similarity search is conducted using the embeddings to identify matching documents to be used as context for the LLM. Although it might not seem particularly useful with just one document, we are effectively working with multiple documents since we \"chunked\" our text. Preselecting the most suitable documents based on semantic similarity enables us to provide the model with meaningful knowledge through the prompt while remaining within the allowed context size.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this exploration, we have discovered the ***significant role that indexes and retrievers play in improving the performance of Large Language Models when handling document-based data***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system becomes more efficient in finding and presenting relevant information by converting documents and user queries into numerical vectors (embeddings) and storing them in specialized databases like Deep Lake, which serves as our vector store database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **retriever**'*s ability to identify documents that are closely related to a user's query in the embedding space demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing the overall language understanding capabilities of LLMs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **A Potential Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has a downside: you might not know how to get the right documents later when storing data. In the Q&A example, we cut the text into equal parts, causing both useful and useless text to show up when a user asks a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including unrelated information in the LLM prompt is detrimental because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It can divert the LLM's focus from pertinent details**.\n",
    "- **It occupies valuable space that could be utilized for more relevant information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Possible Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "A `DocumentCompressor` abstraction has been introduced to address this issue, allowing `compress_documents` on the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ContextualCompressionRetriever` is a wrapper around another retriever in `LangChain`. It takes a base retriever and a `DocumentCompressor` and automatically compresses the retrieved documents from the base retriever. This means that only the most relevant parts of the retrieved documents are returned, given a specific query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular compressor choice is the `LLMChainExtractor`, which uses an LLMChain to extract only the statements relevant to the query from the documents. To improve the retrieval process, a `ContextualCompressionRetriever` is used, wrapping the base retriever with an `LLMChainExtractor`. The `LLMChainExtractor` iterates over the initially returned documents and extracts only the content relevant to the query.\n",
